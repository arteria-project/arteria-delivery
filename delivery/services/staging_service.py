    # "Do you mean to ensure that only one thread tries doing that at a time? An idea could
    #  be to take a database lock to ensure this, i.e. fetch all objects in the unfinished
    #  state, restart them, change the status and then commit, locking the sqlite database
    #  briefly while doing so (I think row level locking is limited in sqlite.)"
