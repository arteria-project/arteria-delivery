#what we are lacking, and what might need to be created outside the config is:
#1. checksums.md5
#2. Encrypted samplesheet
#As far as I know, these don't exist prior to organization.

#  #hypothethical undetermined, needs an input of lane(s) connected to project
#  #We will not include this at this point, as it requires additional input. Will maybe end up in its own config or something.
