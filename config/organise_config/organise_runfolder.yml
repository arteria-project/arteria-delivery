#Input: runfolder_name

#Currently named runfolderpath and runfolder to harmonize with rnaseq config by Monika, but for specific runfolder delivery, technically, these could be "merged" to one.
variables:
  inputkey: "runfolder_name"  
  runfolderpath: "/proj/ngi2016001/incoming"
  runfolder: "{runfolderpath}/{inputkey}"
  organised: "{runfolder}/Projects"

#current path is /proj/ngi2016001/incoming/<RUNFOLDER>/Projects/<PROJECT>/<RUNFOLDER>/
#The following is based on that we are to keep the same directory structure as above.

#The fastq files

#what we are lacking, and what might need to be created outside the config is:
#1. checksums.md5
#2. Encrypted samplesheet
#As far as I know, these don't exist prior to organization.

#  #hypothethical undetermined, needs an input of lane(s) connected to project
#  #We will not include this at this point, as it requires additional input. Will maybe end up in its own config or something.
